    <h3>My Role:</h3>
    <p>I was on the tech team worked on implementing the teleport and reset features. I designed a pin dropping mechanic that
        allows the player to leave checkpoints to teleport back to. It stores a list of Pin actors in the player class, then
        when the player presses the teleport button (left mouse click), gets the most recently placed pin, and moves the player to
        its location, removing the pin in the process. The player is given a maximum of three pins to place, and can use any
        number of them at a time.</p>
    <p>I also designed the game reset mechanic, which is necessary for the puzzles in the game. It is possible to softlock
        yourself out without it. Following a tutorial, I made a system that saves the player location, box locations, and door
        rotations at the start of the game, and when the player reaches a checkpoint. They can then press 'R' to reset back
        to the last checkpoint.</p>
