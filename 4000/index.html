        <h2>Team Jigsaw - Intertwined</h2>
        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>I was on the tech team worked on implementing the teleport and reset features. I designed a pin dropping mechanic that
            allows the player to leave checkpoints to teleport back to. It stores a list of Pin actors in the player class, then
            when the player presses the teleport button (left mouse click), gets the most recently placed pin, and moves the player to
            its location, removing the pin in the process. The player is given a maximum of three pins to place, and can use any
            number of them at a time.</p>
        <p>I also designed the game reset mechanic, which is necessary for the puzzles in the game. It is possible to softlock
            yourself out without it. Following a tutorial, I made a system that saves the player location, box locations, and door
            rotations at the start of the game, and when the player reaches a checkpoint. They can then press 'R' to reset back
            to the last checkpoint.</p>
        <p>The initial concept for the game was also my idea: A puzzle game similar to Monument Valley. We didn't get a chance to
            implement the isometric camera we wanted, but the overall effect still came out good.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>I had never used Unreal Engine, or any modern game engine, before the class so I had to learn how to use the engine
            along with coding the game features. I had also never used blueprints to make full game features. I also had to deal
            with unreal crashing or breaking multiple times on my computer. We also ran into issues with merging the branches
            on GitHub. The player blueprint frequently got data overridden, causing us to lose work and have to re-create
            functionality.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        <p>Most of my problems were solvable by either re-installing Unreal (which I had to do a few times this term), or
            finding solutions to my bugs or technical challenges online. The rest of the team was also helpful for figuring out
            Unreal or GitHub problems when they came up.</p>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>The improvement that would have helped us most was better organization. We didn't have a clear team lead, or
            standard directions and task assignments, so what got done was mostly just whatever people assigned themselves
            to for the week. We also didn't get started on the programming early enough, spending a whole week trying to
            find time to meet and plan out the game.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Version Control</h3>
        <p>We decided to try to use GitHub for version control, without trying to use any extra software to handle Unreal
            files. Overall, it worked, but wasn't ideal. We needed a lot more communication than we had to keep people
            from working on the same files and creating conflicts that lost work. Any of the blueprint files would override
            changes rather than merge them, so if two people both worked on a file, one of them would have to re-make their
            changes during a meeting.</p>
