	<h3><p>The Lord of Silurum is a DnD one shot intended for four level one characters. It is set in the city of Silurum, a town on the coast of a land that has been ravaged by a trio of volcanoes hundreds of years ago and remains an ashy wasteland to this day. Your group of adventurers has taken a job to investigate the murder of the guard captain at the request of the town's leader, Baron Os'Eserev.</p></h3>
