	<h3>People:</h3>

<p>John Everett - The Victoria’s captain <br>
Liv Shotwell - Communications Operative from Iota Base<br>
Jesse - Smuggler </p>

	<h3>General Story:</h3>
<p>Jesse was working with an accomplice to smuggle contraband to Vesta, a newly colonized planet, on board the Victoria, an interstellar spaceship. During the orbital phase, their accomplice messed with the ship’s orbital dynamics systems and caused it to rapidly de-orbit towards the planet. The failsafes were also disabled, and the ship crashed onto the surface a few miles from Iota Station. The captain survived, and is knowledgeable about what systems broke, and the results of those failures. Liv has access to internal communications from the ship, and data about which systems failed, when, and what caused the failures (breaking parts, power loss, etc.). Jesse is present at the scene, and knows that their accomplice was on the ship, but not that he was necessarily responsible, or even that he is dead yet.</p>

<p>You have been dispatched, along with Liz, to discover the cause of the crash. When you arrive, you discover Jesse at the site, and the captain buried in the wreckage, miraculously alive. You and Liz are working to uncover what happened at the site, and Jesse is still trying to find the items he was smuggling in the wreckage.</p>

<p>As you uncover clues, you learn more about the characters, and the order of events on board the Victoria. Jesse is slowly revealed to have snuck out of the Iota station to recover goods dropped into the atmosphere, and is now at the crash site to recover goods. John starts to blame himself for failing to save the ship, and gives up on himself. Liv uses her access to uncover clues and find the black box, a flight recorded that reveals data on how the ship crashed.</p>
<p>After the black box is found, you confront Jesse and they reveal their whole side of the story. You drag them back to Iota Station, and turn them in to the commander. </p>
